# Task4
🚀 Leveling Up My Web Development Journey – Task 4 Completed! 🌟
I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully completed Task 4 of my ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd Internship Program.

This task focused on combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build fully functioning projects:
✅ Personal Portfolio Website – a professional, responsive multi-page site with About, Projects, and Contact sections 🌐
✅ To-Do List with Local Storage – tasks and notes are now saved and retrieved even after refreshing the page 📝
✅ Product Listing Page with Filtering & Sorting – users can filter items by category/price and sort them by rating 📊

This experience helped me strengthen my front-end development skills, practice data persistence, and build interactive interfaces that are both practical and user-friendly. ✨

Looking forward to the upcoming challenges and learning opportunities on this journey! 💻
